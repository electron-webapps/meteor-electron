# meteor-electron

meteor-electron lets you easily transform your Meteor webapp to a desktop app. Its ultimate goal is
to build `meteor add-platform desktop`.

Some of the things it does:

* automatically builds and launches a desktop application, rebuilding when the native code changes
* defines feature detection APIs and a bridge between web and native code
* serves downloads of your application and update feeds

## Getting Started

`meteor add meson:electron`

meteor-electron will download the Electron binary for your system and build and launch an Electron
app pointing to your local development server. The download process may take a few minutes based on
your Internet connection but only needs to be done once.

The app, as well as the ready-to-distribute binaries (see [Deploy](#deploying)), is built within
`YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.meteor-electron`. This allows the apps to be easily located as well as the
builds to be cached for speedier startup. You should add this directory to your `.gitignore`.

## Configuration

Configuration is possible via `Meteor.settings.electron`. For example,

```json
{
  "electron": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "icon": {
      "darwin": "private/MyApp.icns",
      "win32": "private/MyApp.ico"
    },
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "A really cool app.",
    "rootUrl": "https://myapp.com",
    "launchPath": "/app/landing",
    "downloadUrls": {
      "win32": "https://myapp.com/download/win/",
      "darwin": "https://myapp.com/download/osx/{{version}}/MyApp.zip"
    },
    "sign": "Developer ID Application: ...",
    "height": 768,
    "width": 1024,
    "frame": true,
    "title-bar-style": "hidden",
    "resizable": true,
    "protocols": [{
      "name": "MyApp",
      "schemes": ["myapp"]
    }],
    "appSrcDir": "private/app"
  }
}
```

## Electron-specific code

By default, all client web code will be executed in Electron. To include/exclude code use `Electron.isDesktop`

```javascript
if (!Electron.isDesktop()){
  showModal("Have you considered downloading our Electron app?");
}
```

## Deploying

Hot code push will work to update your app's UI just like it does on the web, since the app is loading the UI
_from_ the web. If you want to update the part of the app that interfaces with the OS, though&mdash;to change
the app icon, to add a menu bar icon, etc.&mdash;you'll need to distribute a new version of the `.app` or
`.exe`. Here's how to do that.

### Building and serving an auto-updating Mac app

1. Set `Meteor.settings.electron.autoPackage` to `true` to ZIP your app for distribution after it is
built.
2. If you wish to enable remote updates, you will need to codesign your application. This requires
that you build your app on a Mac with a [Developer ID certificate](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/DistributingApplicationsOutside/DistributingApplicationsOutside.html) installed.
Set `Meteor.settings.electron.sign` to the name of that certificate.
3. Wait for the app to finish building and packaging, then copy
`YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.meteor-electron/darwin-x64/final/YOUR_APP_NAME.zip` to a publically-accessible
location.
4. Set `downloadUrls.darwin` in `Meteor.settings.electron` to the URL of the location where you copied the ZIP.

Downloads of the Mac app will be served at your webapp's `ROOT_URL` + `/app/download?platform=darwin`.

### Building and serving an auto-updating Windows app

0. Make sure that you have specified `name`, `version`, and `description` in `Meteor.settings.electron`.
1. Build the app [on a Mac](#building-for-windows-on-mac), because changing a Windows application icon
[does not work on Windows at present](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager/issues/53).
2. Ensure the URL specified by `Meteor.settings.electron.downloadUrls.win32` has an empty `RELEASES` file.
2. On a Windows machine or in a Windows VM ([not a Mac, at present](https://github.com/atom/grunt-electron-installer/issues/90)),
run the [electron installer grunt plugin](https://github.com/atom/grunt-electron-installer) against your app.
Your Gruntfile should look something like https://github.com/rissem/meteor-electron-test/tree/master/.test.
The value of `remoteReleases` should be your webapp's `ROOT_URL` + '/app/latest'.
3. Copy the output to the server serving `Meteor.settings.electron.downloadUrls.win32`, to be served
from that location.
4. When you publish a new update, run the installer again and it will generate diffs, a new `RELEASES` file,
and new installers. After copying these to `Meteor.settings.electron.downloadUrls.win32` again (overwriting
the `RELEASES` file and installers), apps that check for updates should receive a new version.

Downloads of the Windows installer will be served at your webapp's `ROOT_URL` + `/app/download?platform=win32`.

## Building for Windows on Mac

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
2. `brew update`
3. `brew install wine`
4. Specify a Windows build in your settings (otherwise defaults to current platform (mac)).

```json
{
  "electron": {
    "builds": [
      {"platform": "win32",
       "arch": "ia32"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Q&A

### Q: How is this different from all the other Meteor electron packages?

This package differs from [Electrometeor](https://github.com/sircharleswatson/Electrometeor) and
[Electrify](https://github.com/arboleya/electrify) by *not* baking Meteor into the packaged app.
This makes things significantly simpler, but if you need strong offline support, one of them is a
better solution.

### Q: How can I create new browser windows, set app notifications and all the other awesome native functionality that Electron gives me?

This project selectively exposes such functionality to the client, in a way that is safe and avoids
memory leaks, via the `Electron` module--see [`client.js`](client.js). To request that this module
expose additional functionality, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/rissem/meteor-electron/pull/new/master)
or [file an issue](https://github.com/rissem/meteor-electron/issues/new).

You may also substitute your own application code for `meteor-electron`'s default application by
setting the `appSrcDir` settings option. `meteor-electron` will continue to package your application
and serve the application update feed and download URLs, but in-app functionality will be your
responsibility.  **Warning**: this responsibility includes setting up your application window and menu,
checking for remote updates, registering the `Electron` module (that defines `Electron.isDesktop`),
and possibly other things. If you take this route, it's recommended that you start by copying
`meteor-electron`'s `app` directory.

Also, you also probably want to keep your application code in a subdirectory of your application's
`private` directory so that Meteor will observe changes to it and restart the server; when it does
so, `meteor-electron` will rebuild and relaunch the app.

### Q: How do I prevent the Electron app from being automatically built and launched?

Set `Meteor.settings.electron.autoBuild` to `"false"`.
