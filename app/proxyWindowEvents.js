/**
 * Proxies `BrowserWindow` events to renderer processes as directed by those processes and in a way
 * that avoids memory leaks.
 *
 * For each event that the renderer process wishes to observe, it should send the 'onWindowEvent'
 * message with the event name as argument:
 *
 *   require('electron').ipcRenderer.send('onWindowEvent', 'enter-full-screen')
 *
 * The renderer process will then receive the 'triggerWindowEvent' message when the event occurs:
 *
 *   require('electron').ipcRenderer.on('triggerWindowEvent', function(event, arg) {
 *     console.log(arg); // prints 'enter-full-screen'
 *   });
 *
 * This module, in particular the use of the `ipc` vs. `remote` module, is motivated by
 * https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/remote.md#passing-callbacks-to-the-main-process.
 *
 * @param {BrowserWindow} window - The window whose events to proxy.
